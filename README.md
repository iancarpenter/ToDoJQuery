# The worlds ugliest ToDo list which used to learn a number of JQuery techniques
# Use of .ready() function 
# how to create elements dynamically and attach them to parents such as input box to li to ul
# How to add an event listener to a button
# This was the second one so I learnt so much from my first 100% javascript attempt and saw ways to improve that
# Use of the each() to work with multiple records
# Sometimes pure javascript is best - remove item
# JQuery documentation for each - found out at index when I needed to rewrite the removeItem() (needed to find out which iterator was being selected)
# Less code - compare JS version of remove item with JQuery version
# Testing this found errors with the method used to save locally that required refactoring
